# PowerPair: Solar + Battery Explained

You've seen the solar panels on rooftops around NC. Maybe you've considered them yourself. But here's the part most solar companies gloss over: **standard grid-tied solar shuts off during an outage.**

Yes, really. By law (IEEE 1547), grid-tied inverters must disconnect when they detect an outage. It's a safety measure to protect utility workers. But it means the $30,000 system on your roof is useless exactly when you need it most.

## The Missing Piece: Battery Storage

Battery backup changes the equation entirely:

- **During normal operation:** Solar charges the battery, and excess goes to the grid (you get credits).
- **During an outage:** The system islands — disconnects from the grid and runs your home from stored solar energy.
- **At night:** The battery provides power until the sun comes back and recharges it.

This is what we call **PowerPair** — solar production paired with battery autonomy.

## What Can a Battery Actually Run?

A typical home battery (10-15 kWh) can run:

| Appliance | Wattage | Hours on 10kWh |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Refrigerator | 150W | 60+ hours |
| Wi-Fi Router | 15W | 600+ hours |
| LED Lights (10) | 100W | 100 hours |
| Phone Charging | 20W | 500 charges |
| CPAP Machine | 50W | 200 hours |

The key is **load management** — you don't run everything at once. Prioritize essentials, and a single battery can keep your home functional for days.

## Do You Need Rooftop Solar?

Not necessarily. Portable solar panels (100W-400W) paired with a portable power station (500Wh-2kWh) give you a smaller-scale version of the same concept — with zero installation.

For NC homeowners who:
- Rent their home
- Have tree-shaded roofs
- Want storm backup without a $30K commitment

...portable solar + battery is the practical answer.

## The Honest Take

We sell both: portable power products and full residential solar consultations. Here's when we recommend each:

**Portable power** is right if you want emergency backup, spend time outdoors, or just want to reduce dependence for under $500.

**Full solar + battery** is right if you own your home, have good roof exposure, and want to offset 80-100% of your electric bill while having whole-home outage protection.

We'll never push one over the other. That's the adviser approach — not the sales approach.
