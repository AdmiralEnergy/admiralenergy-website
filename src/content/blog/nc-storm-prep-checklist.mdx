# NC Storm Prep Checklist

North Carolina sits in one of the most active hurricane corridors on the East Coast. We average 2-4 tropical impacts per year, and even "minor" storms can knock out power for days.

This isn't a scare tactic — it's a reality check. Here's what to do about it.

## Before the Season (March – May)

- [ ] **Review your insurance.** Know your deductible and what's covered for wind vs. flood damage. Standard homeowners insurance does NOT cover flooding.
- [ ] **Trim trees near power lines and your home.** Dead branches become projectiles in 60mph winds.
- [ ] **Test your power backup.** If you have a generator or portable power station, fire it up. Make sure it works and you have fuel/solar panels ready.
- [ ] **Stock your emergency kit.** Water (1 gallon per person per day × 3 days), non-perishable food, first aid, flashlights, battery radio, medications.
- [ ] **Download the ReadyNC app.** Real-time storm tracking, evacuation routes, and shelter locations.

## When a Storm Watch Is Issued

- [ ] **Charge everything.** Phones, laptops, power stations, battery packs.
- [ ] **Fill bathtubs with water** for flushing toilets if water pressure drops.
- [ ] **Move vehicles** away from trees. Park in a garage if possible.
- [ ] **Bring in outdoor furniture, grills, and decorations.**
- [ ] **Photograph your home and possessions** for insurance documentation.

## During the Storm

- Stay indoors, away from windows.
- If power goes out, switch to your backup power system.
- Avoid opening the refrigerator — it stays cold for 4+ hours if sealed.
- Use your portable power station for essential devices only.
- Monitor weather radio or phone alerts (conserve battery).

## After the Storm

- Do NOT touch downed power lines. Call Duke Energy: 1-800-769-3766.
- Document all damage with photos before cleanup.
- Run your power station and solar panels to maintain communication.
- Check on neighbors, especially elderly residents.

## The Power Gap

Here's the part most people don't plan for: **the gap between when power goes out and when it comes back.**

After Hurricane Florence (2018), some NC communities were without power for 10+ days. Even a 48-72 hour outage disrupts everything — food spoilage, medication cooling, communication, work-from-home capability.

A portable power station with a solar panel gives you independence during that gap. No fuel lines, no generator maintenance, no carbon monoxide risk.
