## üö® CRITICAL: If Form Still Doesn't Work

If test submissions still don't appear in Netlify after deployment:

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Run Diagnostic Script**
   ```powershell
   .\check-deployment.ps1
   ```

2. **Check Netlify toml Redirects**
   - Edit `netlify.toml` lines 23-36
   - Change `status = 200` to `status = 302`
   - Change `force = true` to `force = false`
   - Commit and redeploy

3. **Contact Netlify Support**
   - URL: https://answers.netlify.com/
   - Include Site ID: `c19958dc-f3e2-4cdb-bd30-9da6d31e8da9`
   - Include Form ID: `68f932529a29f700087ea861`
   - Explain: Users reaching thank-you page but form data not captured
