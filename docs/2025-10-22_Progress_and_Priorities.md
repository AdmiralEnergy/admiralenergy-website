**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Branch:** main  
**Environment:** Netlify (auto-deploy from GitHub)

## 🧭 Summary

Added comprehensive documentation for chatbot implementation and current repository status.

## ✅ Completed Today

### Analytics & Tracking
- ✅ Installed GTM-N6HRP34Z across all 8 HTML pages (index, about, services, powerpair, case-studies, contact, contact-success/thank-you, 404)
- ✅ Verified GTM head script and noscript iframe placement on every page

### Form Flow & Success Page
- ✅ Fixed "Bad request, missing form" error on contact success page
- ✅ Renamed `contact-success.html` → `thank-you.html` to avoid Netlify form handler pattern matching
- ✅ Updated canonical URL in thank-you.html to match new filename
- ✅ Completed truncated HTML on success page (added timeline, CTAs, footer, closing tags)
- ✅ Fixed netlify.toml redirect order (specific rules before catch-all)
- ✅ Added `force = true` redirects for thank-you page static serving
- ✅ Added legacy 301 redirects from old `/contact-success` paths

### Chatbot Integration (The Admiral)

- ✅ Implemented localStorage conversation persistence (20 message limit)
- ✅ Added event delegation for inline chat button openers
- ✅ Configured for gpt-4o-mini model with temperature 0.3
- ✅ System prompt: NC-focused solar & battery advisor, math-first, battery-first

### Content & UX Fixes
- ✅ Fixed broken emoji characters in contact.html (🚪 No Door-to-Door, 📅 Tax Credit)
- ✅ Cleaned up JavaScript TODOs in contact.html
- ✅ Updated form name to `admiral-contact` for consistency
- ✅ Updated JavaScript form selector to match new form name

### CSS & Styling
- ✅ Added `!important` declarations to force consistent border styling over Tailwind
- ✅ Ensured form inputs have visible 2px borders (#d1d5db)

### Documentation
- ✅ Created `docs/2025-10-22_AdmiralEnergy_Status.md` - Repository status snapshot
- ✅ Created `docs/2025-10-22_Chatbot_Implementation_Guide.md` - Complete chatbot setup guide
- ✅ Deleted `styles.css.backup` cleanup

### Deployment & Git Management
- ✅ Resolved merge conflicts in netlify.toml (functions section + redirects)
- ✅ Merged PR #3 (agent routing issue resolution)
- ✅ Synced local state before device switching
- ✅ Pushed 18+ commits with comprehensive messages

## ⚙️ Current Repository State

**Last commit hash:** `eebbfb48eda4378ce4351ffbf8b05b238682d6a6`

**Remote:** origin/main synced ✅

**Outstanding files:** None - working directory clean

**Netlify deploy status:** ✅ Multiple successful deploys today
- Latest deploy includes: GTM installation, thank-you page fixes, chatbot integration, documentation

**Functions deployed:**
- `/.netlify/functions/admiral-chat` (POST endpoint for OpenAI relay)

**Environment variables required (not in repo):**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Must be set in Netlify dashboard
- `ADMIRAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - Optional (defaults to NC-focused advisor prompt)

## 🧠 Decisions & Fixes

### Decision: Rename contact-success to thank-you
**Problem:** Netlify's form handler was intercepting `/contact-success.html` and treating it as a form submission endpoint, returning "Bad request, missing form" error.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. Added `force = false` to redirect rules → Still failed
2. Changed to `force = true` with query parameters → Still failed
3. Reordered redirects (specific before catch-all) → Still failed

**Final Solution:** Renamed file to `thank-you.html` to avoid Netlify's form handler pattern matching. This completely bypassed the issue since the new filename doesn't match Netlify's expected form success page pattern.

**Result:** ✅ Success page loads correctly, form submissions redirect properly

### Decision: Implement Serverless Chatbot Architecture
**Rationale:** Embedding OpenAI API key in client-side JavaScript would expose it publicly. Using Netlify Functions provides secure server-side relay.

**Architecture:**
- Frontend: `admiral-chat-ui.js` (floating button + modal)
- Backend: `netlify/functions/admiral-chat.js` (OpenAI API relay)
- Storage: localStorage for conversation history (client-side, 20 messages max)
- Analytics: GTM events track opens, messages sent, replies received

**Model Choice:** gpt-4o-mini with temperature 0.3 (balance of cost and quality)

### Bug Fix: Form Input Borders Not Visible
**Issue:** Tailwind CSS was overriding custom border styles, making form inputs appear invisible (white on white).

**Fix:** Added `!important` declarations to `.ae-input`, `.ae-select`, `.ae-textarea` classes to force 2px solid borders (#d1d5db) over Tailwind defaults.

### Bug Fix: Broken Emoji Characters
**Issue:** UTF-8 encoding issues showing � instead of 🚪 and 📅 emojis.

**Fix:** Direct replacement with proper UTF-8 emoji characters in contact.html.

## ⏳ Pending / Blocked

### Contact Page Copy Updates (Todo List Items)
- ⏳ Update hero text (remove "get started" pressure language)
- ⏳ Revise trust signals (add genuine differentiators)
- ⏳ Adjust contact options copy (add "honest if not a fit" bullet)
- ⏳ Replace urgency section (federal tax credit context)
- ⏳ Add FAQ entry (explaining when Admiral says "no")
- ⏳ Update final CTA heading

### Testing

## 🎨 Chatbot Enhancement Ideas (Backlog)

- Add streaming responses (SSE) for real-time chat feel
- Implement conversation rating system (thumbs up/down)
- Add "Clear conversation" button in UI
- Create preset questions for common scenarios:
  - "How does PowerPair affect battery sizing?"
  - "What's the ROI on solar + battery in NC?"
  - "Should I wait for better incentives?"
- Integrate with CRM API for lead capture
- Add typing indicator animation
- Mobile drawer optimization (full-screen on small devices)

## 🧾 Notes

### GTM Installation Pattern
All pages follow consistent structure:
```html
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <!-- Google Tag Manager -->
  <script>(function(w,d,s,l,i){...})(window,document,'script','dataLayer','GTM-N6HRP34Z');</script>
  <!-- End Google Tag Manager -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
  <noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-N6HRP34Z"></iframe></noscript>
  <!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
```

### Netlify Redirect Rules Best Practices
- **Order matters:** Specific rules must come before catch-all `/*`
- **Force flag:** Use `force = true` to bypass file existence checks
- **Status codes:** 200 for rewrites, 301 for permanent redirects, 302 for temporary

### Chatbot System Prompt
```
You are The Admiral — an NC-focused solar & battery backup advisor. 
Be math-first, battery-first; reference Duke PowerPair and interconnection realities. 
Avoid hard pricing unless user provides usage/bill. 
Tone: calm, clear, non-pushy.
```

### Device Sync Checklist for Surface Pro 9
