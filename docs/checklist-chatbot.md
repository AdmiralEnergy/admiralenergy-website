# Chatbot Go-Live Checklist

1. Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `ADMIRAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) environment variables in Netlify under **Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment**.
2. Trigger a new deploy (e.g., by redeploying the current commit or pushing a new one).
3. After the deploy finishes, open the site, launch "Chat with The Admiral," send a message, and confirm the chatbot responds.
