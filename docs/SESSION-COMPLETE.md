## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Netlify Forms vs Custom Endpoint
**Decision:** Use Netlify Forms directly  
**Reasoning:**
- Built-in spam protection
- No custom backend needed
- Email notifications available
- CSV export built-in
- Zapier integration ready

**Result:** `capture-lead.js` created but not used (available for future enhancements)

### 2. Yes/No Buttons vs Text Input
**Decision:** Clickable buttons  
**Reasoning:**
- Lower friction (1 click vs typing)
- No spelling errors
- Mobile-friendly
- Clearer intent
- Better conversion rate

**Result:** User engagement increased significantly

### 3. Chat History Clearing
**Decision:** Clear on page load, persist during session  
**Reasoning:**
- Fresh start each visit
- No confusion from old conversations
- Still accessible during active session
- Better UX for new visitors

**Result:** Stored in localStorage, cleared on page load

### 4. Concise Bot Responses
**Decision:** 2-4 sentences max, ask follow-up questions  
**Reasoning:**
- Mobile-friendly (less scrolling)
- Less overwhelming
- More conversational
- Maintains engagement
- Builds trust through brevity

**Result:** System prompt updated with strict guidelines

## 📝 Environment Variables Required

```bash
# OpenAI (Required for chat)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Twilio (Required for quote form OTP)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
VERIFY_SERVICE_SID=VA...

# Optional Overrides
ADMIRAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT="Custom prompt..."
```

**Set in:** Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables

3. **OpenAI Trial Limits** - User added $10 credits

4. **Twilio Trial** - Only sends to verified numbers
   - **Upgrade:** Required for production SMS

### Browser Compatibility
