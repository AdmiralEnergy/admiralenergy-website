# DIAGNOSTIC REPORT: Form Submission Issue
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Issue:** Submissions to `/quote` page not being captured by Netlify Forms  
**Last Known Successful Submission:** October 25, 2025 (4 days ago)  
**Test Submissions (last 20 min):** 3 submissions - ALL LOST  

---

## 🔍 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** The form submission issue has **TWO SEPARATE PROBLEMS**:

1. ✅ **ALREADY FIXED (Oct 30):** Missing static HTML form template for Netlify build bot detection
2. ❌ **NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED:** GTM tracking shows `generate_lead` firing, but form data not reaching Netlify

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Your GTM setup proves the form IS submitting and users ARE reaching `/thank-you/`, but **Netlify Forms is not intercepting the submissions**.

---

## 📊 DATA ANALYSIS

### Reddit Pixel Tracking
- **12 `generate_lead` events recorded** on Reddit
- This event fires on `/thank-you/` page view (see line 239 of `thank-you.html`)
- **PROOF:** Users ARE completing the form journey

### GA4 Tracking
- You mentioned having issues getting GA4 to track properly
- GA4 event also fires on `/thank-you/` page view
- If Reddit is tracking 12 events, GA4 should also show ~12 events (if properly configured)

### Netlify Forms Dashboard
- **Last submission:** October 25th
- **Missing:** All submissions from Oct 26-30
- **Gap:** At least 3 test submissions + unknown number of real leads = LOST DATA

## 🎯 HYPOTHESIS: Why Forms Are Not Being Captured

### Theory #1: ❌ Form Not Registered During Build (RULED OUT - Fixed Oct 30)
The hidden static form template was added to fix this issue.

### Theory #2: 🔥 **MOST LIKELY - Netlify Form Handler Not Intercepting**

**Evidence:**
1. Users successfully reach `/thank-you/` (proven by Reddit pixel)
2. No form data in Netlify Forms dashboard
3. Form attributes are 100% correct
4. Static template exists for build bot detection

**Possible Causes:**

#### A. **Form Handler Race Condition**
The `/thank-you/` redirect might be configured as a URL rewrite instead of a form submission redirect.

**Check this:** In `netlify.toml` lines 23-36:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you.html*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

**PROBLEM:** These are `status = 200` (rewrite) with `force = true`.  
**IMPACT:** If Netlify sees the action="/thank-you/" on the form, it might be treating it as a static redirect instead of a form submission.

#### B. **Form Name Mismatch**
Double-checking form names across all instances:
- Hidden form: `name="admiral-contact"` ✅
- Visible form: `name="admiral-contact"` ✅
- Hidden input: `name="form-name" value="admiral-contact"` ✅

**Status:** All names match correctly.

#### C. **Deployment Issue**
The hidden form was added in the last commit but might not have been deployed yet, OR a previous deployment cached the old form configuration.

#### D. **Netlify Forms Not Enabled for Site**
Unlikely but possible: Netlify Forms feature might be disabled at the site level.

---

## 🔬 VERIFICATION STEPS NEEDED

### Step 1: Verify Latest Deployment
```bash
# Check latest deployment status
netlify deploy list --json | Select-Object -First 1
```

**Look for:**
- Deploy ID
- Deployment state (should be "ready")
- Deployment timestamp (should be after Oct 30 commit)

### Step 2: Check if Form is Registered
```bash
# List all forms detected by Netlify
netlify api listSiteForms --data '{"site_id":"c19958dc-f3e2-4cdb-bd30-9da6d31e8da9"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
Should show `admiral-contact` form with all field names.

**If NOT showing:** The build bot didn't detect the form (deployment issue).

### Step 3: Manual Dashboard Check
Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/admiralenergy/forms

**Look for:**
- Is `admiral-contact` listed?
- When was it last detected?
- What fields does it show?

### Step 4: Check Form Submissions
Visit: https://app.netlify.com/sites/admiralenergy/forms/admiral-contact

**Look for:**
- Last submission timestamp
- Total submission count
- Any error messages

## 🛠️ PROPOSED FIXES

### Fix #1: Remove Conflicting Redirects (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** The `/thank-you/*` redirects with `status = 200` and `force = true` might be interfering with form submission handling.

**Solution:** Change the redirect configuration to NOT force rewrites:

```toml
# Remove these lines (23-36 in netlify.toml):
[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you.html*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

**OR** change to proper redirect (301/302) instead of rewrite (200):

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you.html*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 302  # Changed from 200
  force = false  # Changed from true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/thank-you*"
  to = "/thank-you/"
  status = 302
  force = false
```

**Reasoning:** Netlify Forms needs to intercept the POST request and handle it before any redirects occur. The `force = true` might be bypassing the form handler.

### Fix #2: Simplify Form Action

**Current:** `action="/thank-you/"`  
**Alternative:** `action="/"`

Then add a success redirect in the form HTML:
```html
<form 
    name="admiral-contact" 
    method="POST" 
    action="/"
    data-netlify="true" 
    data-netlify-redirect="/thank-you/"
    netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
```

**Reasoning:** This is the Netlify-recommended approach and might work better with the redirect rules.

### Fix #3: Add Form Notification Webhook

Even if forms aren't showing in the dashboard, you can set up email notifications:

**Dashboard:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/admiralenergy/settings/forms  
**Enable:** Email notifications to `david@admiralenergy.ai`

**Benefit:** You'll at least get the form data via email even if the dashboard is broken.

### Fix #4: Debug with Netlify Support

Since this is affecting real leads, open a support ticket:

**URL:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/admiralenergy/settings/general  
**Subject:** "Form submissions not being captured despite correct configuration"  
**Include:**
- Site ID: `c19958dc-f3e2-4cdb-bd30-9da6d31e8da9`
- Form name: `admiral-contact`
- Issue: Users completing form (proven by Reddit pixel) but data not in Forms dashboard
- Timeline: Last successful submission Oct 25, all submissions since then lost

---

## 📈 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Lost Lead Data
- **Confirmed lost:** 3 test submissions (last 20 minutes)
- **Potential lost:** Unknown real leads between Oct 26-30
- **Reddit data suggests:** 12 total `generate_lead` events
  - Minus last successful submission (Oct 25)
  - **Estimated lost real leads:** 8-11 potential customers

### Business Impact
- **Lost revenue opportunity:** 8-11 potential quotes not followed up
- **Reputation risk:** Customers filled form but never received response
- **Conversion tracking broken:** Cannot calculate true conversion rate

### Trust & Recovery
**Good news:** Reddit pixel is capturing email/phone if you configured user_data hashing.

**Check:** Review Reddit Pixel configuration to see if you're capturing:
- Email addresses (hashed)
- Phone numbers (hashed)

If yes, you might be able to recover some lead data from Reddit's Events Manager.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Priority 1 (DO FIRST):
1. ✅ Verify latest deployment completed successfully
2. ✅ Check Netlify Forms dashboard for `admiral-contact` registration
3. ⚠️ Enable email notifications for form submissions (backup plan)

### Priority 2 (IF FORM NOT REGISTERED):
4. Modify `netlify.toml` redirect rules (remove `force = true`)
5. Redeploy site
6. Test form submission
7. Check dashboard again

### Priority 3 (IF STILL NOT WORKING):
8. Switch to `data-netlify-redirect` approach (Fix #2)
9. Contact Netlify Support with diagnostic data

### Priority 4 (LEAD RECOVERY):
10. Check Reddit Events Manager for any captured user data
11. Review GA4 for IP addresses or referrer data
12. Cross-reference with any email inquiries from same timeframe

---

## 📋 TESTING CHECKLIST

After implementing fixes, test in this order:

- [ ] Submit test form with dummy data
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/thank-you/` works
- [ ] Check browser Network tab: POST request to Netlify successful?
- [ ] Check Netlify Forms dashboard: New submission visible?
- [ ] Check email: Notification received?
- [ ] Check GTM: `generate_lead` event fired?
- [ ] Check Reddit: Event tracked?
- [ ] Submit second test form to confirm consistency

---

## 🎓 ROOT CAUSE SUMMARY

**What we know for certain:**
1. ✅ Form HTML is correctly configured
2. ✅ Users ARE reaching the thank you page (Reddit proves this)
3. ✅ GTM tracking IS working
4. ❌ Netlify Forms is NOT capturing the submission data
5. ❌ The disconnect is happening during the POST → Netlify Forms → Redirect flow

**Most likely culprit:**
The `netlify.toml` redirect rules with `force = true` and `status = 200` are causing Netlify to bypass the form handler and go straight to serving the thank-you page as a rewrite.

**Next step:**
Modify the redirect rules as described in Fix #1, redeploy, and test.
