# AdmiralEnergy.ai Reposition Plan (Pre-Launch Direction)
Owner: David (Admiral Energy)
Goal: Reposition site around (1) selling Generac GB1000 @ $1,049, (2) selling Admiral 200W foldable solar panels, (3) collecting leads for Generac installs in NC (Charlotte + Kings Mountain area).

## 0) Constraints
- Do NOT rewrite the brand from scratch.
- Maintain the existing brand look/feel and colors (current site has a clean, high-contrast, "honest math" tone and layout).
- Streamline navigation (reduce top tabs).
- Keep the "advisor-first / no pressure / honest math" positioning, but shift the hero + primary actions toward:
  - Buy GB1000
  - Buy 200W Panels
  - Get a Generac install quote

---

## 1) Current Site Snapshot (for context)
### Current top navigation (6 tabs)
Home, About, Services, PowerPair, Case Studies, Contact

### Current homepage primary positioning
- Headline: "Keep Your Home Running. No Matter What."
- Battery-first messaging + PowerPair incentive banner
- CTA buttons: "Get Your Backup Plan" and "How It Works"
- Lead magnet: "NC Power Outage Survival Guide" email form
- "Book Free Consultation" CTA near bottom

### Existing "Get a Quote" page
There is already a dedicated form page at: /quote.html, focused on a "Free Quote" and collecting contact + zip/city.

---

## 2) New Information Architecture (IA) + Navigation
Replace the 6-tab nav with **4 items**:

1) **Home**
2) **Shop (Portable Power)**  ← combines "Shop + Portable Power"
3) **Home Resilience Blog**    ← combines "Home Resilience + Blog"
4) **Get a Quote**             ← more blatant lead CTA (points to /quote.html)

### Notes
- Keep About as a footer link, not top nav (still important, but not primary conversion).
- Keep Case Studies as a section inside Home Resilience Blog (or a featured block on Home + blog taxonomy).
- Keep PowerPair as:
  - a blog category / guide page, OR
  - a section on Home Resilience Blog (not a top-level tab), since we're prioritizing Generac installs + GB1000 sales.

---

## 3) Page-by-Page Direction

### A) HOME (Conversion hub)
**Primary objective:** Drive users to:
1) Buy GB1000
2) Browse panels
3) Request Generac install quote (Charlotte/Kings Mountain)

#### Above the fold (new hero)
Replace the current "battery-first" hero emphasis with a product-led hero:

- Headline example:
  "Portable Backup Power + Generac Home Generators — North Carolina"
- Subhead:
  "Shop the Generac GB1000. Bundle with 200W solar. Or get a quote for a Generac install in the Charlotte / Kings Mountain area."
- Primary CTAs (3):
  1) "Buy GB1000" → /shop/gb1000
  2) "Shop 200W Solar Panel" → /shop/200w-solar-panel
  3) "Get a Generac Install Quote" → /quote.html

#### Trust anchor (Aligned Contractor)
Add a small but clear trust strip near the hero (NOT the main headline):
- "Generac Aligned Contractor (NC)"
- Place near CTA buttons or below hero as a badge line.
- Tone: factual, not salesy.

#### Keep what already works (but reposition)
- Keep "No pitch. Just math." as supporting copy (it's a differentiator)
- Keep an incentive mention (PowerPair) but demote it from the top banner to a lower section or blog link (since we're pivoting).

#### Mid-page sections (new order)
1) **Featured Products (above the fold or immediately below)**
   - GB1000 card (price $1,049.00, key outputs + charging highlights, "Buy" button)
   - Admiral 200W Panel card ("coming soon / limited availability" if needed, but we are preparing listing)
   - Optional: "Bundle & Save" callout (if you plan to bundle later)

2) **Why portable power is the new entry point**
   - Explain that portable power + panels allow anyone to benefit from renewable energy without a full residential solar install.
   - Bridge: "Start portable now; upgrade to generator/whole-home later."

3) **Generac Install Leads (Charlotte + Kings Mountain)**
   - Mini section that's clearly generator-focused:
     - "Generac Home Generator Install Quotes"
     - Service area: "Charlotte metro + Cleveland/Gaston County + Kings Mountain"
     - CTA: "Get a Quote" → /quote.html

4) **Social proof / case studies**
   - Keep one featured story, but make it relevant to backup power outcomes.
   - Link to blog/case studies archive.

5) **Lead magnet**
   - Keep the "NC Power Outage Survival Guide" email capture, but ensure it does not distract from product CTAs.
   - Consider adding a checkbox or segmented capture:
     - "Interested in: Portable Power / Generator Install / Battery Backup"

#### Footer
- Keep About/Services/PowerPair/Case Studies as footer links (quick links)
- Add a "Generac Install Quote" link in footer as well.

---

### B) SHOP (Portable Power) — combined page
**Primary objective:** Showcase products above the fold, then educate below.

#### Above the fold: product grid
- Grid/cards for:
  1) **Generac GB1000** (primary)
  2) **Admiral 200W Foldable Solar Panel** (secondary)
  3) (Optional later) accessories kit: MC4 extensions + parallel connectors + "Admiral Solar Add-On Kit"

Each product card should have:
- Image
- Price
- 3–5 bullet highlights
- "View details" button linking to dedicated product page

#### Below the fold: education
- Section: "Portable power is the fastest way to start"
- Explain:
  - Portable power stations + foldable panels = "renewable backup" without permitting
  - Great for outages, hurricanes, camping, WFH continuity
- Soft upsell to generator installs:
  - "Need multi-day whole-home backup? Get a Generac install quote."

---

### C) PRODUCT PAGE: GB1000 (/shop/gb1000)
**Objective:** Sell at $1,049 and capture buyers who might also want panels.

Must-have blocks:
1) Price + buy CTA
2) Key outputs (AC watts, surge, USB-C 65W, etc.)
3) Charging methods (AC + solar input range, MPPT mention, etc.)
4) "Recommended solar pairing" section:
   - 1× 200W panel (basic)
   - 2× 200W panels in parallel (fast-charge)
5) FAQ: compatibility with non-Generac panels (tie back to voltage limits in plain language)
6) Warranty summary (short; link to full)
7) Shipping/returns policy links

Cross-sells:
- "Add 200W panel"
- "Add MC4 extension/parallel kit"

Tone:
- Keep the "honest math" voice. Include real-world expectations:
  - Solar output varies with sun angle/clouds; don't promise full 200W all day.

---

### D) PRODUCT PAGE: Admiral 200W Foldable Solar Panel (/shop/200w-solar-panel)
**Objective:** Prepare listing now even if inventory is inbound.

Page states:
- "Admiral 200W Foldable Solar Panel (ETFE, MC4)"
- Include:
  - Compatibility: "Works with Generac GB1000/GB2000 using included XT90→MC4 adapter"
  - Key specs: Voc/Vmp/Imp/Isc (if final supplier spec sheet is confirmed)
  - Use cases: outages + charging GB1000 faster
  - "Pairs perfectly with GB1000" CTA

If inventory isn't here yet:
- Add an "Email me when available" capture OR pre-order language (ONLY if you can manage expectations).
- If you plan to stock in NC: say "Ships from North Carolina" once true.

---

### E) HOME RESILIENCE BLOG (combined blog + resilience)
**Objective:** SEO + trust building + lead capture (without clutter).

Structure:
- Featured categories:
  - "Generators (Generac)"
  - "Portable Power"
  - "Outage Prep"
  - "NC Incentives (PowerPair)"
- Add a right-rail or in-post CTA component:
  - "Get a Generac install quote" (always present on generator posts)
  - "Shop GB1000" (always present on portable power posts)

Also: migrate "Case Studies" here as a content type (or category).

---

### F) GET A QUOTE (make it obvious)
Use the existing /quote.html as the destination CTA.

Change nav label from "Contact" to "Get a Quote".
On the quote page:
- Add one line at the top:
  "Request a quote for: Generac generator install • GB1000 • Solar panel bundle"
- Add a dropdown field "I'm interested in" (if easy):
  - Generac install quote
  - Portable power (GB1000)
  - Solar panel bundle
  - Not sure (help me choose)

Keep the SMS consent language intact (already present).

---

## 4) SEO / Local Lead Focus (Charlotte + Kings Mountain)
### Add local intent in key places
- Home hero subhead: mention "Charlotte metro + Kings Mountain" naturally.
- Quote CTA: "Get a Generac quote in Charlotte / Kings Mountain"
- Blog posts: location-specific pages/posts:
  - "Generac generator installation Charlotte NC"
  - "Generac generator installation Kings Mountain NC"
  - "Generator permits NC (Charlotte region)"
These will rank and funnel into /quote.html.

### Keep "advisor-first" differentiation
Maintain "No pitch. Just math." as a repeated motif because it's a strong differentiator versus typical installers.

---

## 5) Conversion Design Rules (so Claude doesn't overbuild)
- Every page should have ONE primary action:
  - Home → Buy GB1000 / Quote
  - Shop → View product
  - Product pages → Buy / Add bundle / Quote for install
  - Blog → Quote / Buy (contextual)
- Don't let the "PowerPair" incentive dominate the header like it does today.
- Keep pages fast and simple (no heavy sliders).
- Keep forms minimal.

---

## 6) Implementation Notes for Claude (VS Code)
### Scope of edits
- Update top navigation + routing
- Build:
  - Shop landing page
  - 2 product pages (GB1000 + 200W panel)
  - Blog landing consolidation (Home Resilience Blog)
- Rework Home content order and CTA targets
- Preserve existing typography, spacing system, and color tokens.

### Non-goals
- Do not redesign the entire site.
- Do not change brand palette.
- Do not remove privacy/terms/SMS consent language (compliance).

---

## 7) Content Inputs Claude Will Need (you already have / will provide)
- GB1000 product spec .md (already created earlier in project)
- 200W panel draft spec (to be finalized once supplier datasheet arrives)
- Warranty summary blocks (already prepared earlier)
- "Generac Aligned Contractor" phrasing (keep factual)

---

## 8) Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)
- Top nav is streamlined to: Home | Shop | Home Resilience Blog | Get a Quote
- Home above-the-fold features GB1000 + aligned contractor mention + clear CTAs
- Shop page lists products above the fold with clickable product pages
- GB1000 product page supports sales at $1,049 and cross-sells 200W panel
- 200W panel page exists and is ready to sell when inventory is available
- Quote CTA is prominent across site and routes to /quote.html
- Blog is consolidated and supports SEO + lead capture
