1. **phone_click** - Auto-detects clicks on `tel:` links
2. **email_click** - Auto-detects clicks on `mailto:` links
3. **calendly_click** - Auto-detects clicks containing `calendly.com`
4. **scroll_depth** - Auto-detects scroll percentages (25/50/75/90)
5. **powerpair_view** - Auto-detects page view with RegEx match
6. **case_study_view** - Auto-detects page view with RegEx match

## 📈 Analytics Capabilities Unlocked

### 1. Full Funnel Analysis
```
Traffic Source → Landing Page → scroll_depth → Content Engagement
→ form_start → phone_verified → generate_lead
```

Track drop-off at every stage and optimize accordingly.

### 2. Multi-Touch Attribution
```
Session 1: Homepage → case_study_view → exit_intent (60s engaged)
Session 2: powerpair_view → scroll_depth (90%) → form_start → generate_lead
```

Understand which content touchpoints contribute to conversions.

### 3. Contact Preference Intelligence
```
Compare Conversion Rates:
- Form submissions: generate_lead events
- Phone calls: phone_click events
- Calendly bookings: calendly_click events
- Chat engagement: chat_opened → chat_message_sent
```

Optimize for preferred contact methods.

### 4. Content Performance Scoring
```
High-Value Content = case_study_view + scroll_depth (>75%)
Low-Value Content = Quick exit_intent (time_on_page < 15s)
```

Identify pages that need optimization.

### 5. Lead Quality Segmentation
```
Premium Leads = phone_verified + case_study_view + scroll_depth (90%)
Standard Leads = form_start → generate_lead only
Research Leads = Multiple page views + chat engagement but no conversion
```

Prioritize follow-up based on engagement signals.
