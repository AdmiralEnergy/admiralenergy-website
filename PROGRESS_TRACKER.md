## üö® EMERGENCY FIXES (Completed October 30, 2025)

### Emergency Fix 1: Netlify Forms Not Capturing Submissions
**Status**: ‚úÖ DONE (Completed: October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - 11+ leads lost Oct 26-30  
**Files Edited**: `quote.html`  
**Commit**: `06f070f`

**Problem**: Forms appeared functional but Netlify wasn't capturing submissions.

**Root Cause**: Missing hidden static form template for Netlify build bot detection.

**Solution**:
- Added hidden form with `netlify` attribute (not `data-netlify`)
- Listed all 11 fields for build-time detection
- Verified form registered with 11 fields in Netlify dashboard

**Verification**: Form ID 68f932529a29f700087ea861 now capturing all submissions.

---

### Emergency Fix 2: Netlify Default Thank-You Page Injection
**Status**: ‚úÖ DONE (Completed: October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: HIGH - Broke GA4/Reddit Pixel tracking  
**Files Edited**: `quote.html`, `netlify.toml`  
**Commits**: `ba509b4`, `185b015`

**Problem**: Netlify injected default "Thank you!" card after custom HTML, preventing tracking code from firing.

**Root Cause**: Using `action="/thank-you.html"` triggered Netlify's form success handler.

**Solution**:
- Removed `action` attribute
- Added JavaScript form submission handler with `e.preventDefault()`
- Submit via `fetch()` to Netlify Forms endpoint
- Manual redirect to `/thank-you.html` preserving query params
- Updated `netlify.toml` redirect rules to point to `.html` file

**Result**: Clean custom thank-you page, GA4 `generate_lead` event firing correctly.

---

### Emergency Fix 3: Form Selector Conflict
**Status**: ‚úÖ DONE (Completed: October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Event listener on wrong form  
**Files Edited**: `quote.html`  
**Commit**: `b76dd91`

**Problem**: JavaScript event listener attached to hidden template form instead of visible form.

**Root Cause**: `querySelector('form[name="admiral-contact"]')` selected first match (hidden form).

**Solution**:
- Changed to `getElementById('admiral-contact-form')`
- Added `id="admiral-contact-form"` to visible form
- Hidden template has no ID attribute

**Result**: Form submission intercepted correctly, tracking working end-to-end.

---

### Emergency Fix 4: GA4 & Reddit Pixel Tracking Enhancement
**Status**: ‚úÖ DONE (Completed: October 30, 2025)  
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Missing conversion context  
**Files Edited**: `thank-you.html`  
**Commit**: `6dbaae5`

**Problem**: Basic tracking worked but lacked conversion context and proper event structure.

**Solution**:
- Added `conversion_data` object with transaction_id and method fields
- Added `lead_context` object with UTM params, referrer, landing_page
- Added `ecommerce` object for Reddit Pixel compatibility
- Consolidated duplicate script blocks
- Enhanced debug logging

**Result**: Rich conversion data in GA4, proper Reddit Pixel event structure.

- **File**: `netlify/functions/knowledge-base.js` - Searchable knowledge repository

**Initial Knowledge Base** (6 topics):
1. **powerpair**: Cost, specs, incentives, capacity
2. **solar_roi**: Payback periods, when it makes sense, factors affecting ROI
3. **interconnection**: Duke Energy timelines, approval process
4. **battery_coverage**: Runtime calculations, essential vs heavy loads
5. **company_info**: Admiral Energy details, contact information
6. **when_solar_doesnt_work**: Honest guidance on when to avoid solar

**Search Algorithm**:
```javascript
function searchKnowledge(query) {
  // 1. Lowercase query for case-insensitive matching
  // 2. Check each section's keywords for matches
  // 3. Calculate relevance score (# of keyword matches)
  // 4. Sort by score descending
  // 5. Return top 2 most relevant sections concatenated
}
```

**Integration**:
```javascript
// In admiral-chat.js
const { searchKnowledge } = require('./knowledge-base');
const lastUserMessage = messages[messages.length - 1]?.content || '';
const relevantKnowledge = searchKnowledge(lastUserMessage);

if (relevantKnowledge) {
  enhancedSystemPrompt += `\n\n=== RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE BASE ===\n${relevantKnowledge}\n=== END KNOWLEDGE BASE ===`;
}
```

**Impact**:
- Chat can reference specific factual information

### Enhancement 3: Duke Energy Expert Guide Integration (Commit 9dd8750)

**Source Material**:
- **Document**: Duke Energy Solar Programs in NC Complete Expert Guide for Solar.md (199 lines)
- **Author**: David Edwards, Admiral Energy
- **Content**: Comprehensive expert-level Duke Energy program analysis for Charlotte/NC market

**Knowledge Base Expansion**:
- **Sections Updated** (4): powerpair, solar_roi, interconnection, battery_coverage
- **Sections Created** (3): duke_programs, duke_territories, hoa_solar_rights
- **Total Knowledge Base**: 9 comprehensive topics
- **Keywords**: 67 total across all topics
- **Content**: ~4,500 characters of Duke Energy expertise

**Key Duke Energy Information Added**:

1. **PowerPair Pilot Program**:
   - $9,000 upfront incentive ($3,600 solar at $0.36/watt + $5,400 battery at $400/kWh)
   - Battery Control Program: $552/year for 10 years ($46/month credit)
   - Total 10-year value: $14,520 in Duke incentives
   - First-come first-served capacity (limited availability)

2. **Duke Program Comparison**:
   - **Legacy Net Metering**: Retail rate credit (1:1), grandfathered until Oct 1, 2027 (BEST but ended Oct 2023)
   - **Bridge Rate**: 15-year protection, $0.034/kWh avoided cost, saves ~$1,410+ annually vs Solar Choice
   - **Solar Choice**: Time of Use rates, period-specific credits, requires battery optimization

3. **Territory Specifics**:
   - **Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC)**: Charlotte area, ~14¬¢/kWh, $22/month minimum (better economics)
   - **Duke Energy Progress (DEP)**: Eastern NC, ~15.5¬¢/kWh, $28/month minimum
   - Charlotte/Kings Mountain = DEC territory

4. **Time of Use Arbitrage**:
   - Summer on-peak: 6-9PM weekdays at $0.21-0.22/kWh
   - Off-peak: Rest of time at $0.10-0.13/kWh
   - Battery arbitrage value: $250-350/year from time-shifting
   - Optimal strategy: Charge solar 9AM-5PM off-peak, discharge 6-9PM on-peak

5. **HOA Solar Rights**:
   - Belmont v. Farwig (NC Supreme Court, June 2022): HOAs cannot prohibit solar
   - NC General Statute ¬ß 22B-20 (Solar Access Law)
   - Even explicit restrictions must allow "reasonable use"
   - ~40% of NC homeowners in HOAs - this ruling provides strong protections

6. **Critical Dates & Economics**:
   - Federal ITC: 30% through 2032, then 26% (2033), 22% (2034)
   - Legacy grandfather expiration: Oct 1, 2027
   - Bridge Rate payback: 11-12 years
   - Solar Choice payback: 15+ years without battery
   - Interconnection: 3-6 months total timeline
   - Property tax exemption: Solar adds ~$15K home value, exempt from assessment

**Business Value**:
- Chat transformed from generic solar advisor to Duke Energy specialist
- Specific numbers, dates, timelines in every response
- Charlotte/DEC market focus (Admiral Energy's primary service area)
- Legal guidance (HOA rights) for common objection handling
- Honest economics (post-2023 reduced savings acknowledged)
- Strategic program guidance (Bridge Rate vs Solar Choice)

**Technical Implementation**:
- All 199 lines of Duke guide analyzed and extracted
- 9 knowledge base topics with keyword optimization
- RAG pattern ensures relevant knowledge injected per query
- Knowledge searchable by terms: "duke", "charlotte", "bridge rate", "powerpair pilot", "hoa", "dec", "dep", etc.

- Mobile UX is smooth (no content overlap)
- Conversations maintained across page views (if possible)
- Analytics track chat opens, messages sent, conversions
- Performance impact <500ms on page load
- Fallback if GPT unavailable

**Dependencies**:
- OpenAI GPT API access (may need ChatGPT Plus/Team)
- Design mockup approval
- Mobile testing on real devices

**Risks**:
- OpenAI may not allow commercial embeds (check TOS)
- ChatGPT API limits or rate limiting
- User experience may differ from current chat
- Additional costs vs current OpenAI API implementation

**Alternatives**:
- Keep current OpenAI function implementation
- Hybrid: GPT on homepage, API function on other pages
- Link to external ChatGPT conversation (simplest, least integrated)

**Prompt to Start**:
```
"Start Task 4.1: Research and plan Admiral GPT integration on homepage"
```
