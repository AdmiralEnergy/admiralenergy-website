## ‚ú® Most Common Prompts

### 1. Continue Where We Left Off
```
"Continue Admiral Energy optimization"
```
**What happens**: AI reads PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, finds next task, and starts working.

---

### 2. Start Specific Task
```
"Start Task 1.1: Fix ARIA labels"
```
**What happens**: AI jumps to that specific task and begins work.

---

### 3. Show Current Progress
```
"Show Admiral Energy optimization progress"
```
**What happens**: AI reads tracker and shows what's done, what's next.

---

### 4. Review Before Proceeding
```
"Show me what Task 1.1 will change before starting"
```
**What happens**: AI explains changes without executing them yet.

---

### 5. Test Current State
```
"Test the Admiral Energy site locally with netlify dev"

## üéØ Typical Session Flow

### Starting Fresh Session:
1. **Say**: "Continue Admiral Energy optimization"
2. **AI will**: Read tracker, start next task
3. **AI updates**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md with status
4. **AI commits**: Changes with reference to task ID
5. **You review**: Check the changes
6. **Repeat**: Say "continue" for next task

### Mid-Session:
1. **Say**: "Continue to next task"
2. **AI moves**: To next item in tracker
3. **Automatic**: Status updates, commits

### Ending Session:
1. **Say**: "Commit current progress and summarize"
2. **AI will**: Commit all changes, update tracker
3. **AI summarizes**: What was done, what's next
4. **Next time**: Just say "continue Admiral Energy optimization"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### AI Seems Confused?
```
"Read PROGRESS_TRACKER.md and tell me the current status"
```

### Want to Skip a Task?
```
"Mark Task 1.X as skipped and move to Task 1.Y"
```

### Need to Go Back?
```
"Undo Task 1.X and mark it as NEXT UP"
```

### Want More Detail?
```
"Explain Task 1.X in detail before starting"

## üéì First Time Using This System?

### Prompt Template:
```
"I want to continue the Admiral Energy website optimization.

**That's it!** The system handles the rest.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always test locally** before committing to production
2. **Review changes** before pushing to main branch  
3. **One task at a time** - Don't try to do everything at once
4. **Update tracker** - Keep it current for next session
5. **Read commit messages** - They reference task IDs

---

## ‚ö° Speed Run (Experienced Users)

```bash
# Session start
"Continue Admiral Energy optimization"

# After each task completes
"Continue"

# When done for the day
"Commit and summarize progress"
```
